DeepLearning  

Before you run the assignment scripts you need pytorch and jupyter notebook intstalled  

Assigment1 -> contains solution scripts for Assignment1, it in turn as 3 parts.   
  * Part1 -> as scripts for part1 of the assignment. Each subpart of a part is present as a separate notebook.  
  * Part2 -> as scripts for part2 of the assignment. Each subpart of a part is present as a separate notebook.  
  * Part3 -> as scripts for part3 of the assignment. Each subpart of a part is present in a separate notebook. 

HW2 -> contains the python files for HW2.
  * hw2_seq2seq.sh <test_data_directory_path> <output_file> - will be used for running the model on the test data and storing the result in output_file
  * model_seq2seq.py - this file will be used for training the model

HW3 -> contains the python files for HW3
  * DCGAN.ipynb - is a jupyter notebook for DCGAN model
  * WGAN.ipynb - is a jupyter notebook for WGAN model
  * ACGAN.ipynb - is a jupyter notebook for ACGAN model
